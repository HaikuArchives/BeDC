There are some other opensource DC-clients we can look at. But all I've found 
are released under the GPL, so we can't use any code directly, since BeDC is 
released under the BSD license. But we can look at the code to see how they 
have done things, and look at their comments, documentation, etc. (And it's 
better to do it yourself anyway ;-))

Protocol spec:
Written by the openDCd people: <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/opendcd/directconnect.txt> (The client-server communication looks complete and correct, but the client-client one has some things missing)
The DCTC source also looks well documented.
