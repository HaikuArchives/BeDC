Introduction:
BeDC is a BeOS file sharing client compatible with the Direct Connect protocol.
Currently only chatting works, not filesharing/downloading. The program is in a very early alpha stage,
so expect it to crash and behave strange :) The program doesn't download the hub list from NeoModus (yet), so you
have to get the address of the hub you're connceting to from from a windows client or something. You could also read
the "How to find DC Hubs.txt" file, and download the hub list with your web browser.

Source note:
ColumnListView.h, ColumnListView.cpp, ColorTools.h, ColorTools.cpp, 
ColumnTypes.h, and ColumnTypes.cpp are from the Vision CVS available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vision . If only this had been noted 
before, I would have been saved 3 system crashes :)

BeDC is only available on BeShare at the moment (shared by Ghostride), but as get more stable and useful,
it will be posted at BeBits
