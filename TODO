Features:
* Filesharing :)
* Downloading of the public hub list

Bug fixes:
* Sometimes the text in the output view becomes garbled
* Crashes on exit sometimes, have something to do with the settings...
* People doesn't get the net_server version to display anything in the output window, find out why and fix (I haven't been able to reproduce this)

Misc stuff:
* Make a user interface that doesn't suck
* Restructure the code (Really: Structure the code, it's not very structured at the momemt ;-))
* Clean up the code
* Check for memory leaks, I'm sure there's lots of them
* When I get the functionality in place, optimise the code
